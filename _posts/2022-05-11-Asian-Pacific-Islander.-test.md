## Across Origins and Where People Live
The Puget Sound Region has more than 596,000 people who identify as
Asian Alone and more than 35,000 people who identify as Native Hawaiian
and Pacific Islander Alone, as we discovered [last year during Asian
American and Pacific Islander heritage
month](https://www.psrc.org/whats-happening/blog/celebrating-asian-american-and-pacific-islander-heritage-month).
Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander groups represent a wide
variety of [many different
heritages](https://www.psrc.org/whats-happening/blog/region-has-diverse-asian-and-pacific-islander-heritage)
in the region.

*This year we wanted to dive deeper to learn more about the how Asian
and Pacific Islander experiences vary across different groups based on
their heritage and where they live in our region.*

Aggregate Census data can tell one story about people's experiences, but
underneath that lies a wide variety of individual experiences. Broad
data about race and ethnicity can at times hide how different people
really experience the world.

While writing this post, I learned that [Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander people](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/why-its-time-to-retire-the-term-asian-pacific-islander/)
experience significantly more disadvantages than Asian groups. For
future analyses, I plan to keep the two groupings separate based on our
findings.

## Worker Earnings

#### How do worker earnings for Asian and Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander people compare to other groups?

Asian Alone workers as an overall group have one of the highest median
personal earnings at \$53,000 annually. On the other hand, Native
Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone workers have some of the
lowest median earnings at \$32,000.

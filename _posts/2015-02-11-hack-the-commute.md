Calling all hackers, web designers, app devs, and public data enthusiasts! City of Seattle is hosting [Hack the Commute][hack], a weekend-long hacking spectacular to get people like you mashing up data from agencies like ours.  The hackathon will be the weekend of March 20th, 2015, and a finalists "Championship Round" will occur in April.

PSRC is proud to support this effort by providing datasets such as our recently completed household travel survey, parking data, and more to the effort.

This week there was an introductory kick-off meet at greet at WeWork Seattle, with supporters from City of Seattle, Seattle Dept of Transportation, and PSRC in attendance. It's not too late to join up, though, if you are interested in getting in on the action.

Check out [Regional View][regionalview], our agency's general interest blog, for two recent posts related to the data team here at PSRC.

* [Imagining a future with automated vehicles][trb] — our presentation at this year's Transportation Research Board annual conference in Washington, D.C., and we'll have another post about the TRB conference this week.

* [Affordability a top factor in where to live][hhsurvey] — mining data from our recent Regional Travel Study to examine why people choose to live where they do.

Enjoy!

### Across Heritages and Where People Live 

#### And the challenges but importance of Racial Equity Data

The Puget Sound Region has more than 596,000 people who identify as
Asian Alone and more than 35,000 people who identify as Native Hawaiian
and Pacific Islander Alone, as we discovered [last year during Asian
American and Pacific Islander heritage
month](https://www.psrc.org/whats-happening/blog/celebrating-asian-american-and-pacific-islander-heritage-month).
Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander groups represent a wide
variety of [many different
heritages](https://www.psrc.org/whats-happening/blog/region-has-diverse-asian-and-pacific-islander-heritage)
in the region.

Aggregate Census data can tell one story about people's experiences, but
[underneath that lies a wide variety of individual
experiences](https://www.urban.org/urban-wire/combining-racial-groups-data-analysis-can-mask-important-differences-communities).
Broad data about race and ethnicity can at times hide how different
people really experience the world.

While writing this post, I learned that [Native Hawaiian and Pacific
Islander
people](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/why-its-time-to-retire-the-term-asian-pacific-islander/)
experience significantly more disadvantages than some Asian groups. For
future analyses, I plan to keep the two groupings separate based on our
findings.

#### How do worker earnings for Asian and Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander people compare to other groups?

Asian Alone workers as an overall group have one of the highest median
personal earnings at \$53,000 annually. On the other hand, Native
Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone workers have some of the
lowest median earnings at \$32,000.

#### How do worker earnings vary across different groups of Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander people?

Median earnings vary widely across different groups of Asian, Native
Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander people. Burmese, Other Native Pacific
Islander, Nepalese, Fijian, Marshallese, and Hmong workers in the region
have median earnings of less than \$30,000 per year. On the other end of
earnings, Asian Indian workers have median earnings of over \$97,000 per
year.

**Asian, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders education levels**

Similarly to median earnings, Asian Alone people as a broad group have
some of the highest education levels in the region by race, with 56% of
adults over 25 having obtained a bachelor's degree. Only 11% of Native
Hawaiian and Pacific Islander adults over 25 had obtained a bachelor's
degree.

**How do education levels for Asian and Pacific Islander adults vary
across the region?**

We were interested in looking into how educational levels vary across
the **geographies** of the region. The map below shows that the share of
Asian alone adults over 25 with a Bachelor's degree or higher ranges
vary broadly across the region[[1]](#_ftn1).

Over 60% Asian Alone adults in King County have a bachelor's degree, as
compared to 30% of Asian Alone Adults in Pierce County.

Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander adults have low levels of education
throughout the region, as around 10% of adults have a bachelor's degree
or higher.

## **Intersecting diverse heritage and geography**

**Where do different groups live in our region? How does where different
people live relate to differing levels of earnings and education for
Asian and Pacific Islander people geographically?**

Different groups of Asian people have settled in different parts of the
region. Those groups experience different levels of earnings and
education. As a result of where different groups have settled, in some
places in the region Asian people experience high levels of education
and income, but in other places Asian people experience low levels of
education and income.

The map below shows the top Asian alone group by Census tract in the
region, for those tracts that have more than 200 people in that top
group.

Asian alone people as a total group in King County have high earnings
and education. (And yet again, within King County there is high
variation). The top Asian groups in King County are Chinese, except
Taiwanese,and Asian Indian people -- the groups with high incomes.

Some of groups with the lowest earnings have big populations in Pierce
County, and hence the median income is lower in Pierce County.

The geographic distribution of people's heritages impacts where Asian
people have greater advantages and disadvantages. ***When planning for
racial equity, we must consider the diversity of where people live and
where they come from, and look beneath the surface of regional medians
and average. On the data side, we grapple with the low sample sizes and
often fear reporting.***

#### Using Statistical Evidence to Explain Experiences of Smaller Populations

**How do we report data on important groups when the sample sizes are
small?**

When making this analysis, I had to make several statistical choices in
reporting. I could have not created the two maps that show the
geographic distributions because of low sample sizes by tract.

***As data analysts, we could not report the data at all for fear of
making a statistical error. But if we only report data for large groups
of people, we lose the important experiences of the few.***

So in this case, I chose instead to push the data to a reasonable limit.
I still wanted to use statistical evidence [not statistical
significance](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00857-9) to
make choices, but allow flexibility so that some numbers could be
reported.

On the working earnings charts, I reported the margins of error to help
people see that many of the groups are not statistically significantly
different, but the overall there is very clearly a wide gap across
groups. Unfortunately, I have found that with an educated audience the
error bars often do not communicate this variation. So in this case, I'm
accepting the fact that the statistical results can be possibly
misinterpreted as stronger than they are because I think it is more
important to highlight the disparity than to ensure that the results are
correctly interpreted by all audiences.

For the map of Bachelor's degree shares, I made several judgment calls
to be able to report the data. Here was my thought process: to determine
the threshold for reporting, I found that the ACS has roughly a 10%
sample rate of the population. If the population of adults is 300 by
tract then a conservative margin of error is around 15%; it looks like
the map ranges from shares around 10% to 97% so there is truly a wide
range. For data story telling it should be to use a population of 300
adults as a threshold for reporting. All the other areas of the map with
less than 300 Asian Alone adults were gray. I'm also 100% sure there is
a more robust way of doing this analysis, but I also have to balance my
time with getting information out there. I could spend weeks trying to
do things right and only come out with one data story a year instead of
twenty.

Finally, for the map of where different Asian alone groups live, **my
top priority was to learn where some disadvantaged groups settled in the
region.** I truly wanted to understand where different heritages live
because I am ignorant. So really it was a judgment call based on what is
reasonable to me. The tricky thing is there are so many different groups
of people and small sample sizes. My compromise was to map the group
with the highest population size, and only if that population is greater
than 200 people. This approach is problematic for several reasons.
Showing only the highest group does not show the number of Asian people
overall. There could be a tract with a high number of ten different
groups of people, and the data only shows one of those groups. On the
other hand, there could be a tract that is 100% one group, and the data
doesn't show that either. I probably should have added more detail to
the map, but I left it as is, for simplicity and to push the data out.

**What should we do long term to report data for diverse groups?**

-   Continue to push for larger samples sizes for diverse groups. This
    can mean orders of magnitude larger budget requirements.

-   Supplement statistical data with individual level experience data to
    highlight the variation within groups. I'd love to learn more about
    this!

I enjoyed [this

about overcoming the small-n problem and recommend it if you would like
to learn more.

*Technical notes: For these analyses, we used an R package we built
called [psrccensus](https://psrc.github.io/psrccensus/) that makes it's
really easy to pull ACS, PUMS, and Census data for our region. The code
for this analysis is here:
<https://github.com/psrc/heritage-month/blob/main/aian_2_history_month_region.Rmd>*

*Also I had to learn a ton about including interactive R data
visualizations on github pages with Jekyll for this post. The best
information for this came from this post:
<https://jayrobwilliams.com/posts/2020/09/jekyll-html>. Thanks Rob
Williams!*

level, we had to focus on Asian Alone adults only, and did not have
sufficient data to analyze Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander adults.

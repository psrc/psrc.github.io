## Across Origins and Where People Live
The Puget Sound Region has more than 596,000 people who identify as
Asian Alone and more than 35,000 people who identify as Native Hawaiian
and Pacific Islander Alone, as we discovered [last year during Asian
American and Pacific Islander heritage
month](https://www.psrc.org/whats-happening/blog/celebrating-asian-american-and-pacific-islander-heritage-month).
Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander groups represent a wide
variety of [many different
heritages](https://www.psrc.org/whats-happening/blog/region-has-diverse-asian-and-pacific-islander-heritage)
in the region.

*This year we wanted to dive deeper to learn more about the how Asian
and Pacific Islander experiences vary across different groups based on
their heritage and where they live in our region.*

Aggregate Census data can tell one story about people's experiences, but
underneath that lies a wide variety of individual experiences. Broad
data about race and ethnicity can at times hide how different people
really experience the world.

While writing this post, I learned that [Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander people](https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/why-its-time-to-retire-the-term-asian-pacific-islander/)
experience significantly more disadvantages than Asian groups. For
future analyses, I plan to keep the two groupings separate based on our
findings.

## Worker Earnings

#### How do worker earnings for Asian and Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander people compare to other groups?

Asian Alone workers as an overall group have one of the highest median
personal earnings at \$53,000 annually. On the other hand, Native
Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander alone workers have some of the
lowest median earnings at \$32,000.

#### How do worker earnings vary across different groups of Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander people?

Median earnings vary widely across different racial groups. Burmese,
Other Native Pacific Islander, Nepalese, Fijian, Marshallese, and Hmong
workers in the region have median earnings at of less than \$30,000 per
year. On the other end of earnings, Asian Indian workers earn as median
more than three time those groups at \$97,000 per year.

10 hours per week

Subdividing Census data for Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific
Hawaiian groups by different heritages shows the diversity of
experiences. Subdividing Census data by different geographies in the
region reveals the diversity of experiences of Asian, Native Hawaiian,
and Pacific Islander people across space in the region. Where in the
region do Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islanders have higher or
lower education levels?

 **Asian, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders education levels**
  
  Similarly to median earnings, Asian Alone people have some of the
highest education levels in the region by race, with 56% of adults
over 25 having obtained a bachelor's degree. Only 11% of Native Hawaiian
and Pacific Islander adults over 25 had obtained a bachelor's degree.

**How do education levels for Asian and Pacific Islander adults vary
across the region?**
  
 sian workers' median earnings vary widely across different subgroups of
Asian workers. We were interested in looking into how educational levels
vary across the geographies of the region. The map below shows that the
share of Asian alone adults over 25 with a Bachelor's degree or higher
ranges vary broadly across the region[[1]](#_ftn1).
  
  Over 60% Asian Alone adults in King County have a bachelor's degree, as
compared to 30% of Asian Alone Adults in Pierce County.

Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander adults have low levels of education
throughout the region, as around 10% of adults have a bachelor's degree
or higher.

#### Why do we use Shiny to visualize urban planning data?


Over the past several years, the PSRC data science team has deployed several [Shiny apps](https://shiny.posit.co/) that create interactive web data visualizations to inform regional urban planning.
We recommend other urban planning data experts who program in python and R like us check out Shiny as option. 
Our team does use many other data visualization software packages such as Tableau, Infogram, ArcGIS Story Maps, and yes, Excel.
Shiny is stands out because it allows for clean integration of code along a data pipeline from engineering, to statistics, and into a final product, without a ton of web programming expertise.

We host our Shiny apps on [shiny.apps.io](https://www.shinyapps.io/) so we don't have worry about hosting. Shiny.apps.io has free hosting service, but we pay about $500 a year to get more features like unlimited apps and performance. We've got about 20 apps up there!

We've been developing our coding and Shiny chops on the urban planning data team for about the past ten years, so using Shiny wasn't an overnight, plug and play solution. This year several team members attended the [Posit Conference](https://posit.co/conference/) to increase our Shiny and other programming skills in python and R. Posit is the company that develops Shiny. apps works well for our situation that we have statisticians, GIS experts, and data analysts with a little coding skill who want to push our data into an open venue. If you're a real web developer with skills in javascript and css, Shiny also might not be the thing for you.

#### Here are some my favorite apps we made! Click on the links to see the apps live. 


1. [Regional Transportation Plan Dashboard](https://psrcwa.shinyapps.io/rtp-dashboard/)
The regional transportation plan dashboard is my favorite Shiny app because it integrates with a top planning process at PSRC. Historically, the regional transportation plan has been a hundreds of pages long pdf.
The shiny app brings the transportation plan to life with relevant, easily understandable data in a visually appealing framework. We toiled away to make the graphics match our website and have a modern design.

#### Conclusions

The  [Puget Sound Regional Household Travel Survey](https://www.psrc.org/our-work/household-travel-survey-program) contains detailed information about travel behaviors by race, ethnicity, gender, income, and location. The rich travel survey data source reveals the diversity women's experiences of travel throughout the region. Through the analysis of the Regional Household Travel Survey in this report, key trends have emerged that differentiate women resident's travel patterns from men's travel patterns across all modes. The 2017, 2019, and 2021 household travel surveys collected day-to-day information from households in the central Puget Sound region, such as how we traveled, where we went, how long it tookâ€”even where we chose to live and whether we got home deliveries, prior to COVID-19 and after.

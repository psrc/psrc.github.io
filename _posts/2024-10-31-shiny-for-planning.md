#### Shiny works well for interactive data storytelling


Over the past several years, the PSRC data science team has deployed several [Shiny apps](https://shiny.posit.co/) to inform regional urban planning.

#### Conclusions

The  [Puget Sound Regional Household Travel Survey](https://www.psrc.org/our-work/household-travel-survey-program) contains detailed information about travel behaviors by race, ethnicity, gender, income, and location. The rich travel survey data source reveals the diversity women's experiences of travel throughout the region. Through the analysis of the Regional Household Travel Survey in this report, key trends have emerged that differentiate women resident's travel patterns from men's travel patterns across all modes. The 2017, 2019, and 2021 household travel surveys collected day-to-day information from households in the central Puget Sound region, such as how we traveled, where we went, how long it tookâ€”even where we chose to live and whether we got home deliveries, prior to COVID-19 and after.

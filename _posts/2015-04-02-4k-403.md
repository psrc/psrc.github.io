The official travel model used at PSRC is known as [4K][4kpage]. Originally released in late 2013, 4K is an advanced "four-step" travel model and we use it to analyze the performance of myriad future scenarios of transportation infrastructure.

It's a bit of a beast, though: the model can take about 24 hours to run a single scenario, and until today, each run would fill about 190 GB (gigabytes) of disk space. That's a lot.

With today's release of 4K version 4.0.3, we've made some big improvements. This is a [no new features][nonewfeatures] release: we focused only on fixing bugs and improving the model's disk footprint.

Notable improvements:

* 50% Smaller!  A typical run of 4.0.2 filled 190Gb, down to 90Gb in 4.0.3.
* Consolidated assignment results (road and transit volumes) into a single summary databank, for easier analysis
* Refined summary tables for mode choice results

You can find 4K and its documentation at our [modeling home page][4kpage].

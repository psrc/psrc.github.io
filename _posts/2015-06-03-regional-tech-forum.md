We use models to help us answer a lot of questions.

* How will new light rail lines impact travel in our region?
* If the number of residents and jobs in our regional growth centers doubled, how would that affect regional travel conditions and transit ridership?

Travel modeling is a powerful planning tool for evaluating and understanding the transportation impacts associated with land use, infrastructure, and investment decisions. The upcoming joint meeting of the Regional Technical Forum and Model Users Group has been organized as a "Travel Modeling 101"  session, in which staff will present an introductory overview of PSRC's two travel models and discuss their latest applications and developments.

This event is for travel modelers and general planners alike. Planners with have an opportunity to peel open the "black box" of modeling and learn about how these tools work and can be applied to common planning analyses.

We'll also be talking about the roadmap to future travel modeling work at PSRC, so if this stuff is your cup of tea you won't want to miss this meeting!

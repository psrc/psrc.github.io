#### How do worker earnings vary across different groups of Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander people?

Median earnings vary widely across different racial groups. Burmese,
Other Native Pacific Islander, Nepalese, Fijian, Marshallese, and Hmong
workers in the region have median earnings at of less than \$30,000 per
year. On the other end of earnings, Asian Indian workers earn as median
more than three time those groups at \$97,000 per year.

10 hours per week

Subdividing Census data for Asian American, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific
Hawaiian groups by different heritages shows the diversity of
experiences. Subdividing Census data by different geographies in the
region reveals the diversity of experiences of Asian, Native Hawaiian,
and Pacific Islander people across space in the region. Where in the
region do Asian, Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islanders have higher or
lower education levels?
  
  
  **Asian, Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islanders education levels**
  
  Similarly to median earnings, Asian Alone people have some of the
highest education levels in the region by race, with 56% of adults
over 25 having obtained a bachelor's degree. Only 11% of Native Hawaiian
and Pacific Islander adults over 25 had obtained a bachelor's degree.

**How do education levels for Asian and Pacific Islander adults vary
across the region?**
  
  Asian workers' median earnings vary widely across different subgroups of
Asian workers. We were interested in looking into how educational levels
vary across the geographies of the region. The map below shows that the
share of Asian alone adults over 25 with a Bachelor's degree or higher
ranges vary broadly across the region[[1]](#_ftn1).
  
  Over 60% Asian Alone adults in King County have a bachelor's degree, as
compared to 30% of Asian Alone Adults in Pierce County.

Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander adults have low levels of education
throughout the region, as around 10% of adults have a bachelor's degree
or higher.

## **Intersecting diverse heritage and geography**

**Where do different groups live in our region? Â How does where
different people live relate to differing levels of earnings and
education?**
  
  Different groups of Asian people have settled in different parts of the
region. Those groups experience different levels of earnings and
education, and which is reflected in where the most advantaged and
disadvantaged Asian people live in the region.

The map below shows the top Asian alone group by Census tract in the
region, for those tracts that have more than 200 people in that top
group.

Asian alone people in King County have high earnings and education. The
top Asian groups in King County are Chinese, except Taiwanese,and Asian
Indian people -- the groups with high incomes.

Some of groups with the lowest earnings have big populations in Pierce
County, and hence the median income is lower in Pierce County.

The geographic distribution of people's heritages impacts where people
have greater advantages and disadvantages. ***When planning, we must
consider the diversity of where people live and where they come from,
and look beneath the surface of regional medians.***

*Technical note: For these analyses, we used an R package we built
called* [psrccensus](https://psrc.github.io/psrccensus/) *that makes
it's really easy to pull ACS, PUMS, and Census data for our region. The
code for this analysis is here:

  [[1]](#_ftnref1) Because of data availability at a small geographic
    level, we had to focus on Asian Alone adults only, and did not have
    sufficient data to analyze Native Hawaiian and Pacific Islander adults.

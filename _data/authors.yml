  blurb: Billy is the Program Manager for the data team at PSRC.
         He's been doing travel forecasting since the '90s, and he
         dabbles in software development just enough to be dangerous.
         He has Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Civil Engineering, and feels weird
         talking about himself in the third person.  Hi!

  blurb: Suzanne has a passion for understanding human behavior with statistics.
         She loves to take deep dives in big data and survey results,

         in their code that involve cute animals.

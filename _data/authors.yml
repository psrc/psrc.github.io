  blurb: Billy is the Program Manager for the data team at PSRC.
         He's been doing travel forecasting since the '90s, and he
         dabbles in software development just enough to be dangerous.
         He has Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Civil Engineering, and feels weird
         talking about himself in the third person.  Hi!

  blurb: Brice is a travel modeler with an engineering and planning background.
         He basically builds and plays a real-life version of SimCity every day to solve transportation problems.
         He enjoys building cool software and walking on/around mountains in the Northwest.

- name: Craig Helmann

  blurb: Craig is a travel modeler with a background in transportation planning and traffic engineering.
          He started his career way back in the 1990’s doing traffic signal design and found his way into the
          wonderful world of travel modeling by chance almost 17 years ago.
          Craig is a graduate of the University of Washington and loves solving puzzles which makes his job as a modeler a lot more fun.

  blurb: Stefan is a Senior GIS Analyst / Travel Modeler at PSRC. He works on all aspects of travel model software
        development as well as data integration between models. Prior to PSRC, he spent several years working at
        the University of Washington’s Urban Ecology Research Lab where he used GIS and remote sensing to support
        ecological modeling and research. He holds Master’s degrees in Urban Planning
        and Public Administration from the University of Washington.

- name: Suzanne Childress
  image: /authors/ennazus.jpg
  blurb: Suzanne has a passion for understanding human behavior with statistics.
         She loves to take deep dives in big data and survey results,
         to tease out the hidden relationships. But she really likes when people write print statements
         in their code that involve cute animals.

- name: Elizabeth Sall

  blurb: Elizabeth, a guest correspondant on this blog, has spent the better half of the 
         past decade doing what these guys do...but for San Francisco (specifically, the San Francisco
         County Transportation Authority).  She loves trying to understand human behavior, 
         digging into data, and trying to make sense of the purpose of it all.  As a recent transplant 
         to Seattle, she is looking forward to hanging out more with the awesome folks from the PSRC 
         Data Systems and Analysis team and getting to know a whole new region of people, 
         their behavior (slow drivers!), and transit systems.

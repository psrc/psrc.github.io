  blurb: Billy is the Director of Data at PSRC.
         He's been doing travel forecasting since the '90s, and he
         dabbles in software development just enough to be dangerous.
         Billy has Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Civil Engineering, and feels weird
         talking about himself in the third person.  Hi!

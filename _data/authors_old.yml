  blurb: Billy is the Director of Data at PSRC.
         He's been doing travel forecasting since the '90s, and he
         dabbles in software development just enough to be dangerous.
         Billy has Bachelor's and Master's degrees in Civil Engineering, and feels weird
         talking about himself in the third person.  Hi!

  blurb: Beccah stands at the intersection of policy and analysis as a planner in PSRCâ€™s Data Group.
        She deals with all manners of "land use," from forecasting future people to amassing zoning shapefiles.
        She also staffs the Regional Food Policy Council and hopes to further the melding of art and data.
